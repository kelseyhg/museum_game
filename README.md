# Break-In at the Museum!

This is an educational puzzle-solving game with four phases. In the first phase the player collects items, learning about them using 
a guidebook. In the second, the user does a simple drag-and-drop puzzle. In the third, the player drags and drops items to their
correct locations. Finally, the user must correctly identify the location of a hidden item.
